\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Seq24 Versus Other Sequencers}
\label{subsec:introduction_seq24_vs_others}

   This document describes how to use \textsl{Seq24} \cite{seq24},
   a live-looping sequencer with an interface more like a hardware sequencer
   than the typical software MIDI sequencer.

   What are the advantages of
   \textsl{Seq24} versus others?

\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{subsec:introduction_document_structure}

   The structure of this document is based on the user-interface of
   \textsl{Seq24}.
   The sections are basically provided
   in the order their contents appear in the user interface of
   \textsl{Seq24}.  To help the reader jump around this document, multiple
   links and references are supplied.

   Usage tips
   \index{tips!in document}
   for each of the functions provided in
   \textsl{Seq24} are sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each tip occurs in a section beginning with "Tip:".
   Each tip is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "tips".

   Bug notes
   \index{bugs!in document}
   for some of the oddities found in \textsl{Seq24} are
   sprinkled throughout this document.
   Each bug occurs in a sentence beginning with "Bug:".
   Each bug is provided with an entry in the Index, under the
   main topic "bugs".

   TODO items
   \index{todo!in document}
   are also present, in the same vein.
   This document currently has a lot of them!

\subsection{Let's Get Started!}
\label{subsec:introduction_lets_get_started}

   Let us run \textsl{Seq24}, but run it without using \textsl{JACK}, which
   complicates the discussion of \textsl{Seq24}.  The first
   thing to do is make sure one has no other sound application running
   (unless one wants to risk blocking \textsl{Seq24} or hearing two sounds
   simultaneously, depending on one's sound card and ALSA setup).
   Then start \textsl{Seq24} so that it uses ALSA for
   MIDI.  Provide a default MIDI file so that all elements of the user
   interface can come into play.
   Also use the "\&" character so that we get back to the
   command-line prompt.
%   See \sectionref{sec:seq24_man_page}.

\begin{verbatim}
   $ seq24 click_4_4.midi &
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{seq24-first-screen.png}
   \caption{Seq24 Main Screen}
   \label{fig:seq24_main_screen}
\end{figure}

%  \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{seq24-first-screen.jpg}
%  That figure a bit out-of-date (it does not show the new "Part of"
%  feature), so we've replaced it with a new screen capture.
   
   Then the \textsl{Seq24} main window appears, as shown in
   \figureref{fig:seq24_main_screen}.
